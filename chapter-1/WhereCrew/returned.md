We're back in the present timeline with pockets filled with random junk from our adventures!

# Junk is a little harsh...
Come on - a radiated fish, lake water, and super hard berry seem valuable to you?

# They could be!
Potentially, yes - maybe the berry is hiding something useful inside it.

# It's a tough berry to crack!
You're right - we'll need something sharp to get through its rough exterior.

# Shame about the worm.
Yeah - maybe the ship has something equally sharp around, though.

# Hmm...
The control room isn't the only one you have access to - move through the door in the upper left to get into the dishwashing room.

# What do we have here?
Dodger's dear sink, and a fast-spinning fan.

# Hmm...
Remember, you can type 'look (object)' for a more detailed description of things in your environment.

## How do I crack the berry open?
Get the fan to do the hard work for you by typing 'Throw berry in fan'. You'll get a seed for your troubles.

# What now?
We've got to get the radiation out of the fish somehow - Audrey mentioned the sinks being able to do the job if they had microalgae-filled water in them.

# Microwhat?
Just water, basically. The ship's water won't turn on for some reason, though.

# Hmmm...
Thankfully, we have our own water to fill the sink with courtesy of the past!

# What now?
After putting the water in the sink, throw in the fish to successfully de-radiate it. 

# Nice!
Now it's just a regular dead fish! Gross, but probably appetising to some!

# Like who?!
Didn't you meet a guy that was super hungry?

# Does that mean...
Yep, [back to the future we go!](../ToTheFuture/feedingtime.md)
