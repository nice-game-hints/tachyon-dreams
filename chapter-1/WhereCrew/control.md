Despite all the rumbling and bumbling, nobody seems to be around. What's going on?!

# What can I do?
Typing 'Look' will give you a brief description of the room and your circumstances - click the question mark for a summary. ^[You're in the main control room of the space station, with a central console in the middle of the room - a screen on the back wall is currently switched off.]

You can also move around by using the arrow keys.

# What can I do?
Typing 'Look' listed some things in the room you could investigate.

# Like what?
Like the console - try typing 'look console' from anywhere in the room for a closer look.

# What now?
Dodger was interested in one of the buttons on the console - specifically a red one.

# Hmmm...
All big red buttons should obviously be pushed - get closer to the button by using the arrow keys and moving to the part of the console next to the chair.

# How do I use the button?
You can type 'Push button' or 'Press button' to proceed.

# What now?
That button seems to have caught your eye, type "Press button" to see if anything happens.

## Wah!
The console literally jolted to life! Thankfully, we now have someone to talk to - Audrey is the ship's AI and has a better idea of what happened to the crew than you do.

# What now?
Audrey gave you two items - a REMOTE that lets you travel through time, and a COMPUTER that lets you talk to her and get in-game hints.

Press TAB to see your inventory at any time, and press 'ENTER' while one of the items is selected to read more about it.

# Ready to progress!
Great - type 'use remote' to time travel [into the past!](../ToThePast/index.md)
