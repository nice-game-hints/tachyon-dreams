The future ain't what it used to be.

# What can I find here?
As always, typing 'Look' gives a general description of your environment.

Click the question mark for a summary of the area. ^[A man is warming himself with a burning barrel, a corpse is rotting in the snow, and a chimney sticks up out of the snow. Oh, and there's a snowman. Cute.]

# That's a lot to remember.
Indeed - and specifying what you want to look at by typing 'look (object)' gives even more details.

# Nice to see a fellow human, at least!
At long last! You can talk to him to hear his struggles, mostly revolving around freezing to death due to not finding any oil that day.

# Can I help?
You can certainly have a rummage - typing 'search' and then the specific thing you want to feel around will do just that.

## What should I search?
Search the corpse and the chimney to find their respective items.

# Anything else?
Something indefensible - the snowman's treasured nose. Take it, you monster.

# Snack time!
Hey, why not? Type 'eat carrot' and give Dodger a snack for his hard work.

## Woah!
Hmm. Biting a worm with 'razor sharp teeth', according to its inventory description, doesn't seem like a good idea.

Oh well, into our inventory he goes!

# What now?
We've got some nifty items that should prove useful [back in the past!](/ToThePast/returned.md)
