Back to the opposite-of-past!

# Why am I here, again?
You have a mushroom that has seemingly soaked up oil.

# What can I do with it?
The gentleman by the fire needed oil to keep his fire going. ^[We need to find a way to get the oil out of the mushroom.]

# Can I get a nudge in the right direction?
Don't think of the mushroom as a mushroom - think of it as something spongy that's soaked up a liquid. How do you get the liquid out?

## Tell me how to get the oil out.
Squeeze it! More specifically, stand next to the barrel and 'squeeze the mushroom'.

# Nice!
For our troubles, a crowbar - good for prying things open.

# Does that mean...
Woah, hang on! Before you zip back to the past, wouldn't it be a good idea to see more of the future, first?

# Where can I go?
To the east.

# What can I do here?
There's another guy to talk to, whose struggles are more food-focused.

There's also a big building, and heading inside reveals a mostly-empty aquarium, save for one dead fish.

# Cause of death?
Radiation, apparently. Probably best not to handle it with your bare hands.

# How can I retrieve the fish?
Don't you have something radiation-proof to put it in?

## Like what?
The lead casing from the past! Lead is radiation-proof, after all! 

^[Typing 'use lead case on fish' after climbing the stairs next to the tank will put it in your inventory.]

# Now what?
Audrey might have an idea of what to do with the stinky thing.

Click the question mark to see her response. ^[Can you get rid of its radiation from down there? No. Cleaning it with microalgae-filled water in the ship could do the trick, though.]

## Does that mean...
Yep, we're headed [back to the ship!](../WhereCrew/returned.md)
