All this time travel is making me dizzy!

# Back in the future!
We have a special delivery to make - nothing quite like being a time-travelling food delivery service, is there?

# Who am I delivering to?
The man in the eastern area of the future was hungry, so we're giving him the fish that we cleaned.

# What now?
He gave us an idol that doesn't seem to have much use right now - but that's just about everything we can do in the future completed.

It may be worth noting that the idol has wings.

# Does that mean...
Yep, [back to the past we go!](../ToThePast/returnedagain.md)
