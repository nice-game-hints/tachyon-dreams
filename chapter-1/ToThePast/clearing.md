The clearing to the east provides more questions than answers.

# What can I find here?
Type 'Look' to get a description of your environment, and click the question mark for a summary. ^[There's two rocks, one has a strange red painting on it, and a large statue of a woman is just kind of... there.]

# What kind of painting?
Dodger isn't very insightful here.

# Hmm...
Didn't you literally JUST meet a super intelligent AI?

# How do I talk to her?
Type 'Use computer' to get Audrey's thoughts on the painting.

## What's going on here?
The painting was of 'Margdonian' (alien!) origin, and apparently explains that the statue needs "two godly gifts" to awaken.

# Godly gifts?
The berry we picked earlier hardly seems divine - there must be more to see around here.

# Where can I go?
Further east!

# What do we have here?
Things that DEFINITELY don't belong 300 million years in the past - most notably, a high-tech door with a generator next to it.

Also in this other clearing is a gilled mushroom and lead case.

# Weird...
Remember, you can talk to Audrey to see what she thinks by typing 'use computer.'

# What now?
Audrey wasn't much help here - maybe you can take some of this stuff with you, though?

# Like what?
Like the lead case on the ground!

# What now?
We've done seemingly everything that can be done in the past, for now at least.

# How do I leave the past?
Type 'use remote' and [travel into the future!](../ToTheFuture/index.md)
