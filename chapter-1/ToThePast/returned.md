Back to the opposite-of-future!

# What now?
You should have pockets filled with various future-y things - they're bound to be useful in places that seemed uninteresting earlier.

# Where should I start?
Retracing your steps seems like a good start - maybe the lake is worth a second look?

# Wet as usual.
Wouldn't it be nice to have another souvenir from this era? Something with a smell that would remind you of the past?

# Like what?
Water from the lake.

# Hmmm...
Your inventory should contain something that will hold the water.

## Tell me how to retrieve the lake water.
Type 'Use jar on lake' to safely contain some of the very stinky water.

# What now?
That wasn't the only noteworthy thing in the past - do you remember anything eyecatching and / or mouthwatering?

# Like what?
Like the massive mushroom in the furthest clearing to the east.

# What can I do with it?
Trying to take a piece reveals that its skin is too thick. ^[Having something sharp would certainly help.]

## How do I take a piece of mushroom?
Use the sharp-toothed worm! Typing 'Put worm on mushroom' will reward you with a chunk of mushroom.

# What now?
Dodger seemed to think the mushroom smelled terrible, but familiar. Perhaps you could get him to clarify?

# How?
Type 'smell mushroom' for a more detailed description of its scent.

# What does it smell like?
'Unmistakably oily', apparently - as if the mushroom has absorbed oil into its flesh.

# What now?
Didn't you meet a guy that was looking for oil?

# Does that mean...
Yep, [back to the future we go!](/ToTheFuture/returned.md)
