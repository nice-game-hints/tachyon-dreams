Heading to the temple you are greeted by a locked door.

# How do i open the door?
Using the key on the door, the temple will open.

# What is inside?
Inside the temple you will find a small roof with a fountain, take a look around.

# What is inside the fountain
Upon closer inspection there appears to be an object encased in a gelatinous substance.

## How do i get the object?
if you use the bile on the fountain, the gelatinous substance will melt away revealing a page! I wonder who would be able to deciefer this?

Now you can return to [the shore](theshore.md).
