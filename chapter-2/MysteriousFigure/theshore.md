# What can i do here?
Notice the [bag](bag.md) on the table near Tenas? I wonder what's inside...

## Where should i go now?
Ensuring you have the blood soaked bandage from the bag, take a look around for anything that might be enticed by it...

# What could possibly want blood?
Well, if you saw the large fin around the sea you will know that belongs to a ferocious shark that inhabits the waters. 

## Can i get its attention?
Use the blood on the shark.

# What now?
Inside the shark you find a glove and the bile from its stomach which you scoop into your bag, good thinking, try and look around for what you can use these on...

# What do i do with this glove?
Gloves are good for helping protect your hands usually in gardening, i wonder where those could be used?

# I found something shiny!
In a bush you can see the key! But its surrounded by thorns. Sticking your hand in there unprotected would cause some serious damage, maybe something could help you?

## How do i get this key?
Using the glove on the key, you can get it and now you have the key for the [temple](temple.md) in the east!

# I am back from the temple!
With your page in hand i wonder who could possibly be able to read this...

## How do i decipher this?
If you give the page to tenas, she will decipher it and reveal that *Sing to me at my shrine's gates, and the path will open.*, Where could the shrine be?

# Where is the shrine?
In the ocean there are two pillars sticking up, i wonder what that significance is?

## How do i open the shrines gate?
Warm up those vocal cords because you need to "sing", at which point the gate will open and you can [step through](/Portal/index.md).
