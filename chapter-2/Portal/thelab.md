After the puzzle, you are lead to a laboratory filled with computers, toxic waste... and a vending machine?

# What should i do here?
Take a look around the laboratory, theres lots of different things to look at.

# What is to the east?
To the east is a computer which will give you some information, make sure you "look at computer".

# What is there left to do?
That vending machine could be nice to get a snack, besides you havent had a good snack in a long time.

## How do i do it?
Using the good old method, if you "push machine" you will get some root beer, tasty! However, the can looks bloated and rather dangerous looking. Maybe you shouldn't drink it and perhaps use it for something else...

# What can i do with the root beer?
Remember what the computer said? Something about the emergency exits opening up when the defilers are destabled, how can you destablise the defilers?

## How do i open the exits?
If you "put can in tank", you will throw the root beer into the tanks, casuing a volitle reaction. Now you just sit and watch the fireworks!

Congratulations! You have beaten the game!
