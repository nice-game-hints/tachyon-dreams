Even though you don't usually have a high enough clearance level, it appears you have free roam of the room. There is a central console in the middle of the room and a screen on the back wall which is turned off.

# Lets get a move on, shall we?
Use the arrow keys to move around the room.

# What is this place?
Take a look around by typing "Look" 

# How do i take a closer look at that console?
Type "Look console", this also works with other things specified in the game.

# What now?
That button seems to have caught your eye, type "Press button" to see if anything happens.

# Ok, done.
With a electrical ZAP the console comes to life, revealing the ships helpful AI Audrey appears and talks to the player.

# Finished talking.
After listening to Audrey, you are given a REMOTE and a COMPUTER, pressing TAB allows you to see your inventory. Using the computer allows you to get hints from Audrey when not on the station, yoau can also talk to audrey by typing "talk to audrey".

#Ok, I am ready to progress.
Good. Go ahead and use that remote.

# Let's do this!
You press the remote to go to the distant past and feel yourself dissassemble, moments later, you reassemble and appear [in the distant past](/ToThePast/index.md).

## I am back from exploring the timelines!
Back from your adventure, you should have in your inventory a berry, radiated fish and the lake water. Have an explore around the station and talk with Audrey to try and figure out what to do.

# What so i do with the berry?
Since the berry has a super hard exterior, perhaps you might need to crack it open somehow, now what could be capable of doing that?

## How do i crack it open?
In the dishwashing room, you can see a fan in the background with super sharp blades, typing "Throw berry in fan" will crack it open revealing a seed.

## What am i supposed to do?
If you go into the dishwashing room, you can use the sink to put the water in, type "Put water in sink" once you have done that "Put fish in sink", the microalgae from the water will clean the fish and will be ready to eat! Maybe this will be useful for [future use](/ToTheFuture/index.md).
