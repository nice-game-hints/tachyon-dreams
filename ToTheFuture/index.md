Arriving in the future, things are much more bleak, theres a man huddling over a burning barrel, a dead body and a chimney? Oh, in the corner there's also a snowman, that's a nice touch.

# Let's look around.
If you go up to all the specified environmental objects and "look", you can find a lot of useful things here, you can also talk to the man who will welcome you to the future and talk about his desperate fire situation.

# I'll have a search around...
Typing "Search", then the specific thing you want to search such as the body and chimney.

## What now?
Searching the body and chimney, you should now have the "Jar" and "Cover", you should have also noticed that enticing carrot as the snowmans lovely nose, grab that too.

# The Carrot?
Yes, believe it or not its actually rather important for you to grab this, take a look at it why don't you?

# I looked at the carrot.
Looking at the carrot you see a cute little worm friend! Taking a closer look he has some sharp looking teeth, maybe that will be handy in the future?

# What else is there?
Moving to the east, you find another man, this time leaning on the wall next to a large hole in the wall, you can talk to him much like the other guy.

# Ok, what now?
He mentioned about being hungry, poor guy, anyway wandering through the hole will reveal the coveted radiated fish, dead in the water. What a shame.

## How do i get the fish?
Remember that lead case you picked up earlier? Type "Use lead case on fish", and you will now aquire the fish, it *is* still radiated however, I wonder how we can fix that?

# What now?
Now you have to traverse the timelines in order to obtain the different gifts for the statue, by now you should have most of the items necessary in order to get them.

# Where to?
There is no set order in which to obtain these items, but they do intertwine with one another, so to begin, travel [back to the present](/WhereCrew/control.md).

# I am back from the past!
Nice! by now you should have the fish and the mushroom piece, upon inspecting the mushroom piece, you should notice something weird about how its described i wonder what you do with sponges that have something inside?

## What do i do with it?
If you go to the fire barrel and type "Squeeze mushroom", an oily substance will fuel the fire, and with gratitude the man will hand you a crowbar, which needs to used [in the distant past](/ToThePast/index.md).

# What do i do with the fish?
If you hand the now non-radiated fish to the man outside, he will thank you for the food, and give you waht he thinks is a worthless idol... but to you its actually one of the much needed godly gifts! Well done!
