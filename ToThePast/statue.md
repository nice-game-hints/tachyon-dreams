Heading east, Dodger comes across a large statue in the forest with a mysterious red painting on a rock nearby.

# Look around.
Using look, you notice a large statue and two rocks in the area, one of these rocks has a red painting on it, perhaps Audrey would know about this?

# Ok, lets see what Audrey says.
Using the computer, Audrey will scan the painting and translate it, revealing the statue needs "Two godly gifts". 

# Moving along...
Moving more east, you will come across a large mushroom and a suspiciously high tech boulder with a door and some sort of power generator as well as a lead case on the ground, have a look around and inspect everything to figure out whats going on. You might also want to inform Audrey about this.

# I'm done looking.
Did you get the lead case on the floor? If not, make sure to grab it before you go. Once you are done, you will have to make your way to the [Future using the remote](/ToTheFuture/index.md)

## I am back from exploring the future!
Alright then, with the useful items from the future, you can use them here to get even more items which will help you get the godly gifts. See what you can do with the items you have.

## Well, what do i do?
Since we started next to the lake, lets do that one first shall we? Using your trusty jar and lid, type "Use jar on lake", and you will now have some lovely lake water. If you head eastward to the mushroom, you can remember that the worm has sharp teeth, try typing "Put worm on mushroom", you should get a piece of the mushroom from that.

# How will these help?
Each of these two items are vital for getting each of the godly gifts, the water requires you to go [into the present](/WhereCrew/control.md) and the mushroom piece required you to go [into the future](ToTheFuture/index.md).

## How do i get through that door on the boulder?
For that you will need the crowbar, given by the man at the fire, go to the door and type "use crowbar on door" and once you have done that simply "open door".

# What is this place?
Now you seem to be in a cave with a gem encrusted pool inside, take a look around and see what you can do.

## What am i supposed to do?
If you take the seed that was inside the berry and type "Put seed in pool" you will obtain a fragrant fruit, which is one of the godly gifts!

## Alright! I have the gifts.
Fantastic! Give each item to the statue by typing "give *item* to staute" and the end of game cutscene should play. Congratulations!
