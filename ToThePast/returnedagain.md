Feeling whiplash yet?!

# What now?
For your generosity in the future, we now have a crowbar in the past.

# Clobbering time!
Steady on, don't forget the butterfly effect! Besides, crowbars are typically used for prying things open. ^[And killing Headcrabs, of course.]

# Prying things open?
You know - doors, containers, things of that sort.

# Hmm...
Doors, doors, doors, things of that sort.

## What do I need to pry open?
The suspicious door in the furthest clearing - when you get there, stand close to the door and type 'use crowbar on door' to loosen it.

# What now?
It's not locked anymore - type 'open door' to get inside.

# Hmm...
A large pool of water with gemstones adorning its sides... peculiar indeed.

Don't you have something in your inventory that would enjoy water like this?

# Like what?
Something that would use water to grow.

## Tell me what to do in the cave.
Put the seed we got from the berry in the pool of water by typing 'put seed in pool.'

# What now?
We got a fragrant fruit that Dodger describes as 'smelling heavenly'.

# Finally, something that smells good!
Wouldn't it be a nice thing to give someone, too?

# Didn't I already feed that guy?
Not him! Something that tastes this good should go to someone (or something) important.

## Tell me what to do.
The fragrant fruit and winged idols are actually the godly gifts!

Go to the statue and type 'give fruit to statue' followed by 'give idol to statue'.

# Nice!
That's the end of the game! Congratulations!
